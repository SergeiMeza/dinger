# Contributing

## General

* Code style: No hard rules, but try to stay consistent with what you see.
* Modularize your commits.
* Open PRs against master only. Also, only rebased PRs can be merged.

## Contributing to the code

1. Fork this repository.
2. Create your feature branch.
3. Commit your changes.
4. Push the branch to your fork.
5. Create a new pull request on this repository with your branch.

Note that, if approved, your pull request may have to be closed and 
re-opened by a contributor with write access due to CI restrictions, 
but once merged you will still figure as author of the commits 
nevertheless.
